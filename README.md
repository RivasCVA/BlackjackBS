A mobile app made through React Native that allows users to practice Blackjack Basic Strategy in order to improve their odds at casinos.

## What is Blackjack Basic Strategy?
* Playing Blackjack without strategy brings the casino's edge to about 2%. This means that for every $100 you bet, you will lose $2 in the long term. 
* Playing Blackjack with the **Basic Strategy** ruleset can bring the casino's edge down to about **0.5% or less** depending on the table rules.
* **Blackjack Basic Strategy brings you the best odds amongst any table game at any casino.**

## All Kinds of Table Rules
